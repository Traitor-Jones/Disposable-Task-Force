# Overview

Welcome aboard the Disposable Task Force.  We're very excited to have you join the team.  During your time here, you will pilot our state-of-the-art Cargo Ship and transport Earth's excess trash over to <i>Mars' Super Incinerator</i>

## Premise

From the very start, we wanted to create a fundamentally 3D Game, with 2D Minigames that allow the users to take a break from the exploration, and have some "freshness" by playing the minigames we designed.

We went from topic to topic, and then decided:

> <i>"Why don't we create a space travel game, and when we run into aliens, we play these minigames to escape or advance."</i> - Isaac

# Game Description

# Implementation

## Game Engine

The entirety of the game was created in Unity, and all aspects of the game from:

<ul>
<li> Spaceship Movement
<li> Planet Behaivors
<li> Alien Movement
<li> Minigames
<li> Menu Interfaces
<li> Spawn Algorithms
</ul>

Were created and implemented by all team members, and tested extensively by each other.
